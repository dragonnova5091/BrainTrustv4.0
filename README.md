# BrainTrustv4.0

this is my fourth edition of trying ot make the brain trust. This try will be using a hastable with a paging algorithm to handle the large size of the brain. Additionally, we will be using a queue to implement a firing method as well as multi threading to speed up the firing speed. 
All operations need to be completed in O(c) time.
